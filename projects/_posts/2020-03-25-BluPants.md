BluPants is a free web based coding environment (IDE). You can start with 
very basic drag and drop command set; then advance to more sophisticated 
commands until you get more experienced and can completely migrate to native 
Python. Documentation for BluPants Python module can be found 
[here](https://blupants.org/help).

After assembling your robot and connecting it to the Internet, all you need
to do is to visit [http://blupants.org](http://blupants.org) and start coding.

Train your Lego Ev3 robot to pick-up blocks and deploy them to the goal. 
Use the distance sensor to avoid obstacles and more. Take your robotics 
and coding classes to a whole new level. We have successfully run 
[sessions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P2isnXGbCA8tp4052R-veGKMgPXnL8qSOJocW4qevEg/edit?usp=sharing) 
with kids from [kindergarten](https://twitter.com/PattersonPDogs/status/1236031367525396481) 
to high school with a lot of learning and fun.
